# ML-diabetes-patient-readmission
#### Hospital readmission of patients with diabetes using Machine Learning Classification Methods

**Project Objective**<br />
Identify the most efficient classification model that would lead to predicting the patientâ€™s readmission to hospitalized environment.<br /><br />
**Dataset**<br />
The data used to help answering the research objectives derive from The University of Carolina, School of Information and Computer Science (Dua & Graff, 2019). The dataset can be used from students and researchers freely by using the authors citation. The dataset covers 10 years of clinical care within 130 United States hospitals and healthcare facilities. There are 55 variables representing patient and hospital outcomes with more than 100.000 observations<br /><br />
